## $\color{lightskyblue}{\textsf{About Me}}$

### $\color{red}{\textsf{I began my coding journey in the early 2000s, writing my very first program in BASIC on guess what? A TI-83+ calculator.}}$ $\color{darkorange}{\textsf{It was during this time that my love for making things easier grew. There are countless complex problems in the world}}$ of data, and I am determined to uncover the truth within it. The stock market has always fascinated me, which is why I embarked on my newest challenge: to achieve consistent returns from the market with a program of my own creation. I thoroughly enjoy delving into the nuances of data, and I am passionate about seeing it through. I believe I am close to creating my magnum opus, and I cannot wait for what lies ahead!
