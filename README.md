## $\color{lightskyblue}{\textsf{About Me}}$

### I began my coding journey in the early 2000's with my very first program written in BASIC with guess what? A TI-83+ calculator.  It was there my love of making things easier grew.  There are so many complex problems that we face in the world of data and I want to find the truth in it.  The stock market was and is fascinating to me and that is why I embarked on my newest challenge to gain consistent returns from the market with a program created by me.  I thoroughly enjoy the nuances of the data and I am passionate about seeing it through.  I do believe that I am close to creating my Magnum Opus and I cannot wait for what lies ahead!
